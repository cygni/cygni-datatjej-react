Intro:

    All 2 users liked the idea of the community. We should go
    forward and introduce some order. We are in Germany after all.
    Let's add a couple of admins.

    Initially we only had users in the in-memory database. After
    introducing Admins, we need to fix the types so that
    everything works well together.

Exercise:

    Type "Person" is missing, please define it and use
    it in persons array and logPerson function in order to fix
    all the TS errors.

  name: string;
  age: number;

}

interface Admin {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  role: string;
}

export type Person = unknown;

/* const persons: User[] = [
  {
      name: 'Max Mustermann',
      age: 25,
      occupation: 'Chimney sweep'
  },

      name: 'Jane Doe',
      age: 32,
      role: 'Administrator'
